Space Vector Model Search System In NTLK Reuters Corpus

This is a project I did for my Graduate Course: "CSC 9010, TOP: Information Retrieval", Fall 2017.
<br>In this project:
<ul><br><li> Inverted index posting lists constructed from Reuters Corpus</li>
<br><li> Search result ranked by TF-IDF scores and space vector model</li>
</ul>
<br> <b>Content</b>
<br>0. Introduction
<br>1. Inverted Posting List Construction
<br>2. TF-IDF Weight of Each Term
<br>3. Comparison Between SnowballStemmer (first) and PorterStemmer (second)
<br>4. Some Numbers
<br>5. Vector Space Model To Search
<br>6. Search System Evaluation

The presentation is host in Jupyter where all the Python code used in demonstrated:
